        <p>The west coast is no stranger to wildfires or the smoke accompanying it. An increasing number of fires in recent years has plagued the region. As the flames consume homes and forests, they also release a toxic mix of pollutants into the air, including fine-particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds which can travel far from the site of the fire, carried by the wind and spreading the smoke and associated health risks to communities both near and far.</p>

        <p>Thirteen of the twenty largest fires in California history have occurred in the last five years, and environmental scientists predict that the size and frequency of said fires will <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-08-25/wildfires-climate-change-california" style="color:#fa9000">increase drastically</a> as the region grapples with global warming and drought in the coming years.</p>

        <p>However, the effects of wildfire smoke are not limited to the immediate area of the fire. In fact, the smoke can have significant impacts on the health of individuals and the environment hundreds, even thousands of miles away. Like in Denver where the air quality dipped to the worst in the world for three-days straight as smoke from the Dixie fire, and neighboring fires in Oregon and Nevada, blanketed the city in a thick haze.<p>


        <p>Wildfire smoke is particularly hazardous due to the mixture of particulates burned organic and artificial materials. As the fire burns through inorganic material, like plastic and rubber, the toxic gases emitted from them attach to the other smoke particles and create an amalgamation of unhealthy fumes.<p>

        <p>As the smoke moves further away from the source, other atmospheric pollutants get caught up in it, making the noxious cloud all the more harmful. Research has shown that wildfire smoke causes up to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22600224/wildfire-smoke-worse-air-pollution" style="color:#fa9000">10% increase</a> in respiratory-related hospitalizations, while other pollutants only account for a 1% increase.<p>

        <iframe title="Air Quality Index following the Dixie Fire" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-55ZOP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/55ZOP/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
        </script>
      </div>

        <p>The initial short-term health problems from inhalation of smoke particles can be respiratory effects, eye irritation, congestion, headache, cough, and chest tightness, “but that’s just the beginning of a whole cascade of effects,” says Gillian Mittelstaedt, an air quality and environmental health professional. <p>


        <div class="blockquote">
          <h4 class="fst-italic">“Wildfire smoke was associated with higher Covid transmission, because if you have a lot of particulates in the air, you have something for the virus to bind to.”</h4>
       </div>

        <p>The ultra-fine particulates from wildfire smoke circumvent the body’s natural forms of filtration and have been found in “…every single organ of the body, it’s in your kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, and most significantly in the brain.” “It [smoke] settles in our brain and has inflammatory and neurologic effects,” adds Mittelstaedt.<p>

        <p>“The cilia and mucus in your upper and lower respiratory system is designed to be sticky and to catch and dispel foreign matter. But ultra-fine particles completely bypass our mucociliary system and lodge into the lungs.”<p>

        <p>While respiratory problems are the primary concern with smoke inhalation, the increase in transmission of aerosol viruses is also a problem that has become abundantly clear in the era of Covid. “Wildfire smoke was associated with higher Covid transmission because if you have a lot of particulates in the air, you have something for the virus to bind to,” notes Mittelstaedt.<p>

        <p>The ultra-fine particles in wildfire smoke can stay suspended for a longer period of time and behaves more like a gas than a particle. Whereas larger particles will slowly fall to the ground, wildfire smoke particulates and smaller ones can stay in the air for 2-5 hours, depending on the temperature and wind patterns.<p>

        <p>Despite having a similar populace and population density, neighboring Yolo County had significantly lower Covid-19 transmission rates during the Delta variant surge than Butte County, which can likely be attributed to the poor air quality in Butte County, of which Yolo was spared of due to wind patterns taking the smoke east.<p>

        </div>

        <p>As wildfires intensify in the coming years, the nation will have to grapple with more frequent air quality warnings and the negative health effects that come with smoke inhalation. Wildfires are not just a problem for the west coast, data shows the smoke affects everybody – and aside from policy change or stricter guidelines regarding greenhouse emissions that contribute to global warming, the next best thing is to adapt to the new norm of persistent smoke days.<p>


        <p>As of now, aside from wearing a properly fitted N-95 mask on days with poor air quality, the next best way remain healthy is by using an indoor air filter. “We’re not going to wear masks inside, but that’s where we’re getting a lot of our exposure. We spend 22 hours a day inside a structure, so air filtration is vitally important,” Mittelstaedt says.<p>
